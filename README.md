# Sketchware Pro website
This is the source code of the official Sketchware Pro website created by [NiceSapien](https://github.com/nicesapien).
This website was built with vanilla html, css and JavaScript. Only the Material You library was used for some buttons and dividers.

You can visit the website [here](https://sketchware-pro.vercel.app).

## Contributing
This website doesn't really need any contributions, so I recommend you to contribute to [Sketchware Pro](https://github.com/Sketchware-Pro/Sketchware-Pro) instead. Even so, you can make the website prettier if you want! Unfortunately, I haven't written a proper contributing guide, but you should be able to understand most of the code. If you want to create a new page, copy, rename and use the scaffold.html file as a template.
