### Documentation updated
At first, they have added links to docs in the app. Although there are more docs on this website, they will not be added.

### Java 11 support

Sketchware Pro now supports Java 11. That means you can now develop more cool and complex apps. It only works in minApi26, sadly.

### Syntax highlighting
Editing Kotlin and XML code was a mess earlier. Now it's getting better and cleaner with syntax highlighting for XML and Kotlin.

### Help them improve
You can now finnaly send crashlogs directly from the app instead of joining there Discord server.

### Auto-installer
If your device has **Root access**, then Sketchware Pro can automatically install compiled apks, instead of opening android's package manager.

### Inject just got better
ou can now use e.g. `tools:replace="android:id"` in a View's inject property to remove android:id from its XML code. This is a replacement for XML Command Blocks that change tiny things like these.

### Other features and fixes
Projects using Google maps work now. bundletool(1.11.3), sora-editor(0.17.2), Firebase Realtime Database(19.3.1), built-in material library(1.6.1), r8(3.3.75), and Kotlinc(1.7.10) also got updated.
You can now add Admob ad units again, some Proguard errors were fixed, Some fixes to projects exported to Android Studio, and moreover, the import AdMob details from another project Button works now.
