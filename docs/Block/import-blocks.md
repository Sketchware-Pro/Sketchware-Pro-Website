# Import blocks in Sketchware
To import block in Sketchware pro you need block file generated by exporting block.

For example I am going to use [File.json](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BVXQmYPJ-kHlt70y4j4eZt7TpMlUOhnJ/view?usp=drivesdk) and trying to import block from this file to Sketchware pro.

Step 1 : Go to Sketchware and click on 3 dots.
