:::warning Course is incomplete

Hello, while the content of the course is valid, you should know that it is still being written. Taking the course in its current condition will not get you a certificate. Even so, the course has a lot to teach right now aswell! It should be completely written by May 2025. 

:::


# Introduction
The Sketchware Pro course is for complete beginners who have never programmed before. This course will walk you from being a complete beginner to an intermediate developer, and you will be able to build apps of your own ideas by the end of this course. You will also get a free certificate for completing this free course!

## Who am I
Before telling you more about the course, I want to tell you about myself.
I'm NiceSapien. A developer from India. I am the one who created this course. Although I'm primarily a web developer now, my interest in coding and programming was caused by Sketchware. I will be your guide throughout the course.

## About the course
Throughout the course, you will learn several new things and features of Sketchware Pro. You will have to complete 4 projects to get your certificate. The fourth project is going to be a project you'll build absolutely by yourself.
You can also join the Discord server if you have any questions or need help.
