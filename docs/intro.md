### Features

- Custom Blocks: Sketchware Pro allows users to create, use and share custom blocks.
- Local Library: This feature allows developers to download and use local libraries in their projects.
- No Ads: The Pro version does not contain ads and is free to use.
- Additional Components: There are various extra components added in the pro version such as Google Login, Notification, Phone Auth, Rewarded Video Ad and more.
