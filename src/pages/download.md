We've made a few changes to the Logic Editor. **Please make sure to make a backup of your entire .sketchware folder before you try this beta out**! There might be bugs in the editor, and they could corrupt your projects. Please check in the Issues section before you report any.

# What's new
In short,
<ul>
<li>Java 1.9, 10, and 11 compile support! This only works in minApi26 builds though</li>
<li>Syntax highlighting for Kotlin and even XML files.</li>
<li>When Sketchware Pro crashes, you can now send the error message to us. It's fully optional though, so please make sure to send them if you want to help us fix bugs!</li>
<li>New features using root access: Auto-installing of projects, and also launching of projects if auto-install is enabled and worked.</li>
<li>You can now use e.g. <code>tools:replace="android:id"</code> in a View's inject property to remove <code>android:id</code> from its XML code. This is a replacement for XML Command Blocks that change tiny things like these. </li>
<li>Add new docs and update exisiting ones by <a href="https://github.com/NiceSapien">@NiceSapien</a> in <a href="https://github.com/Sketchware-Pro/Sketchware-Pro/pull/557">#557</a></li>
</ul>
